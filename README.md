An effort to make a clone of [Google Keep](https://keep.google.com) in play-scala with Firebase.
It should, in the end, have: 

- A login system that saves user data to Firebase
- A note system that allows logged-in users to create notes, which are saved to Firebase
- A settings page in which a user can edit his/her settings

---------------------------------------

The project's main focus is to learn Scala/Play and Firebase.
